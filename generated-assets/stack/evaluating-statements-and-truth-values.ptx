<statement><div><p>A statement is a sentence (or a mathematical expression) that has a well-defined truth value, <br/>either <alert>True</alert> or <alert>False</alert>.</p>
<p>Use the definition of statement to say whether or not the following sentences are statements and justify your answer.</p>

<solution><div><h3>Worked solution</h3>

<p>(a) "<m>8</m> is not a perfect square."</p>
<p>This <alert>is</alert> a statement because it makes a clear assertion about the number 8, which can be objectively verified. In this case, the statement is <alert>true</alert> because <m>8</m> is not a perfect square (as it cannot be expressed as the square of an integer).</p>

<br/>

<p>(b) "<m>15 - 6</m>"</p>
<p>This <alert>is not</alert> a statement because it is an incomplete mathematical expression. It lacks an operation, such as addition or subtraction, to form a valid mathematical statement. As a standalone expression, it doesn't have a truth value.</p>

<br/>

<p>(c) "<m>15 - 6 = 0</m>"</p>
<p>This <alert>is</alert> a statement because it makes a clear assertion about a mathematical relationship between <m>15</m> and <m>6</m>. However, the statement is false because <m>15 - 6</m> does not equal <m>0</m>; it equals <m>9</m>.</p>

<br/>

<p>(d) "<m>3x - 2 = 10</m>"</p>
<p>This <alert>is not</alert> a statement because it is an incomplete mathematical equation. The presence of the variable <m>x</m> means that the truth value depends on the value assigned to <m>x</m>. Without knowing the value of <m>x</m>, we cannot determine the truth value of the equation.</p>

<br/>

<p>(e) "if <m>x=4</m>, then <m>3x-2=10</m>"</p>
<p>This <alert>is</alert> a statement because it presents a conditional relationship between two mathematical expressions. The statement is true because if <m>x</m> is equal to <m>4</m>, then <m>3x - 2</m> equals <m>10</m>.</p>

<br/>

<p>(f) "<m>8,000,000</m> is a very big number."</p>
<p>This <alert>is not</alert> a statement because the term "very big" is subjective and lacks a well-defined truth value. What is considered "very big" can vary from person to person, making the statement unclear and subjective.</p>

<br/>

<p>(g) "It is the highest peak in the world."</p>
<p>This <alert>is not</alert> a statement because it uses the pronoun "it" without specifying what "it" refers to. Without knowing the subject being referred to, the statement lacks clarity and a definite truth value.</p></div></solution>
