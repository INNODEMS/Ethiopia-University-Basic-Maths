<p>"The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees."</p>
<p>The Triangle Sum Theorem states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always equal to a straight angle, which measures 180 degrees thus the statement is true.</p>
<br/>





<p>"<m>2 + 4 = 8</m>"</p>
<p> Here, we are claiming that <m>2 + 4 = 8</m> which is <alert>False</alert>. 
<br/>Therefore, this is a false statement.</p>
<br/>



<p>"Division by zero is defined "</p>
<p>The statement is false because in mathematics, division by zero is considered undefined because it leads to various contradictions and inconsistencies. When we divide a number by a very small positive number, the result becomes extremely large. As the divisor approaches zero, the quotient tends to infinity, which is not a finite and well-defined value. On the other hand, if the divisor approaches zero from the negative side, the quotient tends to negative infinity.</p>
