<solution><div><h3>Worked solution</h3>

<p>(a) The elements of <m>A</m> are those which are elements of <m>\mathbb{Z} = \{ ... , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... \}</m> and which are in the interval <m>{-3} \leq x \leq {5}</m>.
<br/>Therefore, <m>A = {\left \{-3 , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \right \}}</m></p>

<br/>

<p>(b) The elements of <m>B</m> are those which are elements of <m>\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ... \}</m> and which are in the interval <m>{-6} \leq x \leq {5}</m>.
<br/>Therefore, <m>B = {\left \{1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \right \}}</m></p>

<br/>

<p>(c) We should check to see whether the elements of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are contained in the other set respectively.
<br/>We can see that every element of the set <m>B</m> is also an element of the set <m>A</m>. <br/>However, not every element of the set <m>A</m> is an element of <m>B</m>, for example -3.
