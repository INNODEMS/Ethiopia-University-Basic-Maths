<statement><div><p>Consider the following statement, and construct its converse, inverse, contrapositive and negation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><alert>Statement:</alert> "If 1+1=3, then 2+2=5."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Construct the converse, the inverse, the contrapositive and the negation of the given statement.</p>
<p>1. Converse:[ 2+2 not equal to 5, is a sufficient condition for 1+1 not equal to 3. | It is not the case that 1+1=3 only if it is not the case that 2+2=5. | 1+1=3 if 2+2=5. | 1+1 equal to 3 and 2 +2 not to 5. ]</p>
<hr/>
<p>2. Inverse:[ It is not the case that 1+1=3 only if it is not the case that 2+2=5. | 1+1=3 if 2+2=5. | 1+1 equal to 3 and 2 +2 not to 5. | 2+2 not equal to 5, is a sufficient condition for 1+1 not equal to 3. ]</p>
<hr/>
<p>3. Contrapositive:[ 1+1=3 if 2+2=5. | 2+2 not equal to 5, is a sufficient condition for 1+1 not equal to 3. | 1+1 equal to 3 and 2 +2 not to 5. | It is not the case that 1+1=3 only if it is not the case that 2+2=5. ] </p>
<hr/>
<p>4. Negation:[ It is not the case that 1+1=3 only if it is not the case that 2+2=5. | 1+1=3 if 2+2=5. | 2+2 not equal to 5, is a sufficient condition for 1+1 not equal to 3. | 1+1 equal to 3 and 2 +2 not to 5. ]</p></div></statement>
