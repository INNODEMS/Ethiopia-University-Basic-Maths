<hr/>
<p><alert>Proof:</alert></p>
<p>Let <m>S</m> be the statement "<m> {\sqrt{11}} </m> is irrational".</p>
<p>1. To start the proof, we suppose that <m> \neg S </m> is true.</p>
<p><br/><m> \neg S </m> is the statement that says "<m> {\sqrt{11}} </m> is [ rational | without radical | with radical | irrational ]"  . <br/>2.

Since <m>{11}</m> is [ integer | natural number | prime number | coprime number ], <m>{11}</m> [ divides p | does not divide p ] (<m> \divideontimes </m>). So there exists <m>k \in \mathbb{N} </m> such that <m>p = {11} k</m>.    <br/>5. By substituting <m>p = {11} k</m> in (<m> \star </m>), we get that <m>{11} q^2 = {11}^2 k^2 </m>, which in turn is equivalent to <fillin characters="15" name="ans8"/> after simplifying it by <m>{11}</m>.  <br/> Thus <m> {11} </m> divides <m>q^2</m>, which implies <m>{11}</m> divides <m>q</m> (<m> \ast </m>). <br/>6. From (<m> \divideontimes </m>) and (<m> \ast </m>), we have <m>{11}</m> divides <m>p</m> and <m>{11}</m> divides <m>q</m>. Thus the assumption <m> \neg S </m> is [ contraposition | true statement | induction | a contradiction ], <br/><m> \neg S </m> must be false.

<p><alert>Proposition</alert> "<m> {\sqrt{11}} </m> is irrational"</p>
<hr/>
<p><alert> Proof: </alert></p>
<p>Let <m>S</m> be the proposition: "<m> {\sqrt{11}} </m> is irrational"</p>
<p>1. To start the proof, we suppose that <m> \neg S </m> is true. <m> \neg S </m> is the statement that says "<m> {\sqrt{11}} </m> is rational.</p>
<p>2. By definition of rational number, <m> {\sqrt{11}} \in \mathbb{Q} </m>, <m> \exists (p, q) \in \mathbb{N}^{2} </m> such that <m> {\sqrt{11}} = \frac{p}{q}</m> with</p>
<p><m> gcd(p, q) = 1 </m> ( i.e. <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors, means, in particular <m>{11}</m> does not divide both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> ).</p>
<p>3. When both sides of the equation <m> {\sqrt{11}} = \frac{p}{q} </m> are squared, it follows that <m> {11} = \frac{p^2}{q^2} </m>, which implies <m> p^2 = {11} q^2 </m> (<m> \star </m>).</p>
<p>So, <m>{11}</m> divides <m>p^2</m>.</p>
<p>4. Since <m>{11}</m> is prime number, <m>{11}</m> divides <m>p </m> (<m> \divideontimes </m>).</p>
<p>So there exists <m>k \in \mathbb{N} </m> such that <m>p = {11} k</m>.</p>
<p>5. By substituting <m>p = {11} k</m> in (<m> \star </m>), we get that <m>{11} q^2 = {11}^2 k^2 </m>, which in turn is equivalent to <m> q^2 = {11} k^2</m> after simplifying it by <m>{11}</m>.</p>
<p>Thus <m> {11} </m> divides <m>q^2</m>, which implies <m>{11}</m> divides <m>q</m> (<m>\ast </m>).</p>
<p>6. From (<m> \divideontimes </m>) and (<m> \ast </m>), we have <m>{11}</m> divides <m>p</m> and <m>{11}</m> divides <m>q</m>. Therefore the assumption <m> \neg S </m> is a contradiction,</p>
<p><m> \neg S </m> must be false. That is, the statement <m>S</m>: "<m>{\sqrt{11}}</m> is irrational" is true. We have proved that <m> {\sqrt{11}} </m> is irrational.</p>

<p><alert>Proof Comprehension questions</alert> <br/>1. The type of proof used is proof by contradiction. <br/>2. The formal definition Def<m>_{1} </m> is used in step 2. <br/>3. It is true that by choosing the pair <m> (p,q) \in \mathbb{N}^2</m>, the formal definition Def<m>_{1}</m> is used effectively. <br/>4. The formal definition Def<m>_{2} </m> is used in steps 3, 4 and 5. <br/>5. The sum, the product of two irrational numbers is not irrational. Thus the claim is false.</p></div></solution>
