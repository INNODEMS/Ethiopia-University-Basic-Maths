<solution><div><h3>Worked solution</h3> 
<p><m> (a) </m> By writing the linear equation <m> {5\cdot y+x=0} </m> in slope-intercept form, <m> \displaystyle {y=-\frac{x}{5}} </m>, </p>
<p> you can see that the line has a slope: <m>m=\displaystyle {-\frac{1}{5}}</m>. </p>
<p>The line through the point <m> ({4},{1}) </m> that is parallel to the given line also has the same slope: <m>\displaystyle {-\frac{1}{5}}</m>.</p>
<p> The general equation form is <m>y-y_1=m(x-x_1) </m></p>
<p> Substitute <m>{1}</m> for <m>y_1 </m> and <m>{4}</m> for <m>x_1 </m>, we have </p>
<p><m>{y-1} = \displaystyle {-\frac{1}{5}}({x-4}) </m></p>
<p><m>y = \displaystyle {\frac{9}{5}-\frac{x}{5}} </m> </p>
<p><m> (b)</m> By writing the equation <m>{y+5\cdot x=-3}</m> in slope-intercept form, we can get a slope <m> m_1</m> of the line </p>
<p> and thus find  <m> m_2</m> of the perpendicular line, using the negative reciprocal of  <m> m_1</m>.</p>
<m>{y+5\cdot x=-3}</m> <m> \implies  \displaystyle {y=-5\cdot x-3}</m>
<p>Therefore, <m> m_1 = \displaystyle {-5}</m> and <m> m_2= \displaystyle {\frac{1}{5}}</m></p>
<p>From there, using  <m> m_2</m>, we can compute the equation of a line passing through <m> ({4},{1}) </m> </p><p>which is perpendicular to <m>{y+5\cdot x=-3}</m> as asked in the question.  </p>
<p><m>y-y_1=m_{2}(x-x_1) </m>, </p>
<p><m>{y-1} = \displaystyle{\frac{1}{5}}({x-4}) </m></p>
<p><m> y= \displaystyle {\frac{x}{5}+\frac{1}{5}} </m> </p></div></solution>
<answer><p><m>y=\frac{9}{5}-\frac{x}{5}</m></p></answer>
<answer><p><m>y=\frac{x}{5}+\frac{1}{5}</m></p></answer>
