<p>An equation of a line <em><alert>l</alert></em> is an equation which must be satisfied by the coordinates (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) of every point on the line. A line can be vertical, horizontal or oblique. The equation of a vertical line that intersects the <em>x</em>-axis at (<em>a</em>, 0) is <em>x=a</em> because the <em>x</em>-coordinate of every point on the line is <em>a</em>. Similarly, the equation of a horizontal line that intersects the <em>y</em>-axis at (0, <em>b</em>) is <em>y=b</em> because the <em>y</em>-coordinate of every point on the line is <em>b</em>.</p>
<p>An oblique line is a straight line which is neither vertical nor horizontal. To find equation of an oblique line we use its slope which is the measure of the steepness of the line. In particular, the slope of a line is defined as follows.</p>

<p>The slope of a vertical line is not defined. Note that the slope of horizontal line is 0.</p></cell>

<p>Thus the slope of a line <em><alert>l</alert></em> is the ratio of the change in <em>y</em>, ∆<em>y</em>, to the change in <em>x</em>, ∆<em>x</em> (see Figure 4.4). Hence, slope is the rate of change of <em>y</em> with respect <em>x</em>. The slope depends also on the angle of inclination of the line. Note that the angle of inclination <em>θ</em> is the angle between <em>x</em>-axis and the line (measured counterclockwise from the direction of positive <em>x</em>-axis to the line). Observe that</p>
<p>Therefore, if <em>θ</em> is the angle of inclination of a line, then its slope is <em>m</em> = tan<em>θ</em>.</p>
<p>Now let us find an equation of the line that passes through a point P<sub>1</sub>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>) and has slope <em>m</em>. A point P(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) with <em>x</em>≠<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line though P<sub>1</sub> and P is <em>m</em>; that is</p>
<p>This leads to the following equation of the line:</p>

<p><alert>Example 4.3:</alert> Find an equation of the line <alert><em>l</em></alert> if</p>
<p>(i) the line passes through (3, −2) and its angle of inclination is 135°.</p>
<p>(ii) the line passes through the points (1, 2) and (4, −2)</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> (i) The slope of <em><alert>l</alert></em> is <em>m</em>= tan(135°) = −1; and it passes through point (3, −2). Thus, using the point-slope form with <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>= 3 and <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>= −2, we obtain the equation of the line as</p>
<p><em>y –</em> (−2)= <em>−</em>1(<em>x –</em>3) which simplifies to <em>y =</em> −<em>x +</em> 1.</p>
<p>(ii) Given the line passes through (1, 2) and (4, −2) , the slope of the line is</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So, using the point-slope form with <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>= 1 and <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>= 2, we obtain the equation of the line as</p>
<p>which simplifies to 4<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em> =10.</p>
<p>(Note that it is possible to use the two-point form to find the equation of this line)</p>
<p><alert>General Form</alert>: In general, the equation of a straight line can be written as</p>
<p><em>ax</em> + <em>by</em> + <em>c</em> = 0,</p>
<p>for constants <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> not both zero. Indeed, if <em>a</em>=0 the line is a horizontal line given by <em>y</em> = −<em>c/b</em>, if <em>b</em>=0 the line is a vertical line given by <em>x</em> = −<em>c/a</em>, and if both <em>a</em>, <em>b≠</em> 0 it is the oblique line given by <em>y</em> = –(<em>a/b)x</em> − <em>c/b</em> with slope <em>m</em> = –<em>a/b</em> and <em>y</em>-intercept −<em>c/b</em> .</p>
<p><alert>Parallel and Perpendicular lines:</alert> slopes can be used to check whether lines are parallel, perpendicular or not. In particular, let <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub> and <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub> be non-vertical lines with slope <em>m</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>m</em><sub>2</sub>, respectively. Then,</p>
<p>. (i) <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub> and <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub> are parallel, denoted by <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub> || <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2,</sub> iff <em>m</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>m</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>(ii) <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub> and <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub> are perpendicular, denoted by <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub>⊥ <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub> , iff <em>m</em><sub>1</sub><em>m</em><sub>2</sub>= −1 (or )</p>

<p>Moreover, if <alert><em>l</em><sub>1</sub></alert> and <alert><em>l</em><sub>2</sub></alert> are both vertical lines then they are parallel. However, if one of them is horizontal and the other is vertical, then they are perpendicular.</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.4:</alert> Find an equation of the line through the point (3,2) that is parallel to the line</p>
<p>2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em> +5=0.</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> The given line can be written in the form which is the slope-intercept form; that is, it has slope <em>m</em> = −2/3. So, as parallel lines have the same slope, the required line has slope −2/3. Therefore, its equation in point-slope form is which can be simplified to 2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em> =12.</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.5:</alert> Show that the lines 2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em> +5=0 and 3<em>x</em>−2<em>y −</em> 4 = 0 are perpendicular.</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> The equations can be written as and from which we can see that <em>m</em><sub>1</sub>= −2/3 and <em>m</em><sub>2</sub>= 3/2 . Since <em>m</em><sub>1</sub><em>m</em><sub>2</sub>= −1, the lines are perpendicular.</p>
