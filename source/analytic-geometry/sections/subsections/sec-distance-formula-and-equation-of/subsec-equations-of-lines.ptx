    <title>Equations of lines</title>
    <p>An equation of a line <em><alert>l</alert></em> is an equation which must be satisfied by the coordinates (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) of every point on the line. A line can be vertical, horizontal or oblique. The equation of a vertical line that intersects the <em>x</em>-axis at (<em>a</em>, 0) is <em>x=a</em> because the <em>x</em>-coordinate of every point on the line is <em>a</em>. Similarly, the equation of a horizontal line that intersects the <em>y</em>-axis at (0, <em>b</em>) is <em>y=b</em> because the <em>y</em>-coordinate of every point on the line is <em>b</em>.</p>
    <p>An oblique line is a straight line which is neither vertical nor horizontal. To find equation of an oblique line we use its slope which is the measure of the steepness of the line. In particular, the slope of a line is defined as follows.</p>

                The <alert>slope</alert> of a non-vertical line that passes through the points

                    m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x }=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
                </me>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The slope of a vertical line is not defined. Note that the slope of horizontal line is 0.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>


    <p>Thus the slope of a line <em><alert>l</alert></em> is the ratio of the change in <em>y</em>, ∆<em>y</em>, to the change in <em>x</em>, ∆<em>x</em> (see Figure 4.4). Hence, slope is the rate of change of <em>y</em> with respect <em>x</em>. The slope depends also on the angle of inclination of the line. Note that the angle of inclination <em>θ</em> is the angle between <em>x</em>-axis and the line (measured counterclockwise from the direction of positive <em>x</em>-axis to the line). Observe that</p>
    <p>
        <me>
            tan \theta =\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
        </me>
        
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, if <em>θ</em> is the angle of inclination of a line, then its slope is <em>m</em> = tan<em>θ</em>.</p>
    <p>Now let us find an equation of the line that passes through a point <m>P_1</m>(<m>x_1</m>, <m>y_1</m>) and has slope <em>m</em>. A point P(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) with <em>x</em>≠<m>x_1</m> lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line though <m>P_1</m> and P is <em>m</em>; that is</p>
    <p>
        <me>
            \frac{y-y_{1}}{x-x_{1}} = m
        </me>
        
    </p>
    <p>This leads to the following equation of the line:</p>
    <p>
        <me>
            y-y_{1}=m\left ( x-x_{1} \right ) \, \text{( called point-slope form of equation of a line).}
        </me>
        
    </p>

    <p>In general, depending on the given information, you can show that the equations of oblique lines can be obtained using the following formulas.</p>

        <alert>Parallel and Perpendicular lines:</alert> slopes can be used to check whether lines are parallel, perpendicular or not. In particular, let <m>I_1</m> and <m>l_2</m> be non-vertical lines with slope <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m>, respectively. Then,

                The given line can be written in the form <m>y= \frac{-2}{3}x-\frac{5}{3}</m>
