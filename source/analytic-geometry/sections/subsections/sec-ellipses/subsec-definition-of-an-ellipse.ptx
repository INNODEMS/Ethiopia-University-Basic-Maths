<title>Definition of an Ellipse</title>

<cell><alert>Definition 4.4</alert>: Let F and F<alert>′</alert> be two fixed points in the plane. An <alert>ellipse</alert> is the locus or set of all points in the plane such that the sum of the distances from each point to F and F<alert>′</alert> is constant. That is, a point P is on the ellipse if and only if |PF|+ |PF<alert>′</alert>| = constant. (See Figure 4.18).</cell>
</row>
</tabular>
</table>
<p>The two fixed points, F and F<alert>′</alert>, are called <alert>foci</alert> (singular- <alert>focus</alert>) of the ellipse.</p>
<p>Note also the following terminologies and relationships about ellipse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The midpoint C between the foci F<alert>′</alert> and F is called the <alert>center</alert> of the ellipse.</p></li>
<li><p>The longest diameter (longest chord) V<alert>′</alert>V through F<alert>′</alert> and F is called the <alert>major axis</alert> of the ellipse; and the chord BB<alert>′</alert> through C which is perpendicular to V<alert>′</alert>V is called <alert>minor axis</alert>.</p></li>
<li><p>The endpoints of the major axis, V′ and V, are called the <alert>vertices</alert> of the ellipse.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the definition, |V′F′| + |V′F| = |VF′| + |VF| ⇒ |V′F′| = |VF| ⇒ |CV′| = |CV|. Hence, C is the midpoint of V<alert>′</alert>V. We denote the length of the major axis by 2<em>a</em>. That is, |CV| = <em>a</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>⇒ |VF′| + |VF| = |V′V| = 2<em>a</em>.</p>
<p>⇒ |PF′| + |PF| = 2<em>a,</em> for any point P on the ellipse.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We let <alert>|</alert>BC<alert>|</alert> = <em>b</em>. (You can show that C is the midpoint of BB<alert>′</alert>. So, |B′C| = <em>b.</em> )</p></li>
<li>
<p>The distance from the center C to a focus F (or F<alert>′</alert>) is denoted by <em>c</em>, i.e., |CF| = <em>c</em> = |CF<alert>′</alert>|.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, since |BF<alert>′</alert>|+ |BF| = 2<em>a</em> and BC is a perpendicular bisector of F<alert>′</alert>F, we obtain that</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>|BF<alert>′</alert>| = |BF|= <em>a</em> . Hence, using the Pythagoras Theorem on ∆BCF, we obtain</p>
<p><image source="/media/png72/imageC2301.png" /> or <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>− <em>c</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>(<alert>Note:</alert> <em>a</em> ≥ <em>b</em>. If <em>a=b</em>, the ellipse would be a circle with radius <em>r =a =b</em> ).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The ratio of the distance between the two foci to the length of the major axis is called the <alert>eccentricity</alert> of the ellipse, and denoted by e. That is,</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>e = <image source="/media/png72/imageC2302.png" />. (Note that 0 &lt; e &lt; 1 because 0 &lt; <em>c</em> &lt; <em>a</em> )</p>

<p>1. Suppose F<alert>′</alert> and F are the foci of an ellipse and B<alert>′</alert> and B are the endpoints of the minor axis of the ellipse, as in Figure 4.18. Then, show that each of the followings hold.</p>
<p>(a) ∆BF<alert>′</alert>F is isosceles triangle.</p>
