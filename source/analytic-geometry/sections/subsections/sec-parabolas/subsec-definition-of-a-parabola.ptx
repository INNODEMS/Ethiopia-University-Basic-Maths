<title>Definition of a Parabola</title>

<cell><alert>Definition 4.3:</alert> Let <em>L</em> be a fixed line and F be a fixed point not on the line, both lying on the plane. A <alert>parabola</alert> is a set of points equidistant from <em>L</em> and F. The line <em>L</em> is called the <alert>directrix</alert> and the fixed point F is called the <alert>focus</alert> of the parabola.</cell>

<p>This definition is illustrated by Figure 4.12.</p>

<li><p>Note that the point halfway between the focus F and directrix <em>L</em> is on the parabola; it is called the <alert>vertex,</alert> denoted by V.</p></li>
<li><p><alert>|</alert>VF| is called the <alert>focal length</alert>.</p></li>
<li><p>The line through F perpendicular to the directrix is called the <alert>axis</alert> of the parabola. It is the line of symmetry for the parabola.</p></li>
<li><p>The chord BB′ through F perpendicular to the axis is called <alert>latus rectum</alert>.</p></li>
<li><p>The length of the latus rectum, i.e, <alert>|</alert>BB<alert>′|</alert>, is called <alert>focal width</alert>.</p></li>

<p>Letting <alert>|</alert>VF <alert>| =</alert> <em>p</em><alert>,</alert> you may show that <alert>|</alert>BB<alert>′|</alert> = 4<em>p</em>; i.e., focal width is 4 times focal length.</p>
<p>If P(<em>x,y</em>) is any point on the parabola, then by the definition, the distance of P from the directrix is equal to the distance between P and the focus F. This is used to determine an equation of a parabola. To do this, we consider first the cases when the axis of the parabola is parallel to one of the coordinate axes.</p>
