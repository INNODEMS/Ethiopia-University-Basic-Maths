                Let L be a fixed line and F be a fixed point not on the line, both lying on the
                plane. A parabola is a set of points equidistant from L and F. The line L is called the
                directrix and the fixed point F is called the focus of the parabola.

        This definition is illustrated by Figure 4.12.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Note that the point halfway between the focus F and directrix <em>L</em> is on the parabola; it is called the <alert>vertex,</alert> denoted by V.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                VF| is called the <alert>focal length</alert>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The line through F perpendicular to the directrix is called the <alert>axis</alert> of the parabola. It is the line of symmetry for the parabola.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The chord BB′ through F perpendicular to the axis is called <alert>latus rectum</alert>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The length of the latus rectum, i.e, <alert>|</alert>BB<alert>′|</alert>, is called <alert>focal width</alert>.
            </p>

    <p>
        Letting <alert>|</alert>VF <alert>| =</alert> <em>p</em><alert>,</alert> you may show that <alert>|</alert>BB<alert>′|</alert> = 4<em>p</em>; i.e., focal width is 4 times focal length.
    </p>
    <p>
        If P(<em>x,y</em>) is any point on the parabola, then by the definition, the distance of P from the directrix is equal to the distance between P and the focus F. This is used to determine an equation of a parabola. To do this, we consider first the cases when the axis of the parabola is parallel to one of the coordinate axes.
