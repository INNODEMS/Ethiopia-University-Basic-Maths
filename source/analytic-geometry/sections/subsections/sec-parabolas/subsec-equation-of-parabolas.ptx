<title>Equation of Parabolas</title>

<p><alert>I: Equation of a parabola whose axis is parallel to the <em>y</em>-axis</alert>:</p>
<p>A parabola whose axis is parallel to <em><alert>y</alert></em>-axis is called <alert>vertical parabola</alert>. A vertical parabola is either open upward (as in Figure 4.13 (a) ) or open downward (as in Figure 4.13 (b)).</p>
<p>Let <em>p</em> be the distance from vertex V(<em>h,k</em>) to the focus F of the parabola, i.e.,<alert>|</alert>VF<alert>|</alert> = <em>p</em>. Then, by the definition, F is located <em>p</em> units above V if the parabola opens upward and it is located <em>p</em> units below V if the parabola opens downward as indicated on Figure 4.13(a) and (b), respectively. To determine the desired equation, we first consider the case when the parabola opens upward.</p>
<p>Therefore, considering a vertical parabola with vertex V(<em>h,k</em>) that opens upward (Figure 4.13a), its focus is at F(<em>h, k+p</em>). ⇒ The equation of its directrix is <em>y = k−p.</em></p>
<p>Then, for any point P(<em>x,y</em>) on the parabola, <alert>|</alert>PF<alert>|</alert> is equal to the distance between P and the directrix if and only if</p>

<cell><p>called standard equation of a vertical parabola,</p>
<p>vertex (<em>h, k</em>), focal length <em>p,</em> open upward.</p></cell>
</row>

<p>In particular, if the vertex of a vertical parabola is at origin, i.e., (<em>h, k</em>) =(0,0) and opens upward, then its equation is</p>
<p><image source="/media/png72/imageC2282.png" /> ( In this case, its focus is at F(0, <em>p</em>), and its directrix is <em>y =−p</em> )</p>
<p>If a vertical parabola with vertex V(<em>h, k</em>) opens downward, then its directrix is above the parabola and its focus lies below the vertex (see Figure 4.13(b). In this case,</p>
<p>the focus is at F(<em>h, k−p</em>), and its directrix is given by <em>y=k+p</em>. Moreover, following the same steps as above , the equation of this parabola becomes</p>

<p>In particular, if the vertex of a vertical parabola is at origin, i.e., (<em>h, k</em>) =(0,0) and opens downward, then its equation is</p>
<p><image source="/media/png72/imageC2284.png" /> ( In this case, its focus is at F(0,−<em>p</em>), and its directrix is <em>y = p</em> )</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.14</alert>: Find the vertex, focal length, focus and directrix of the parabola <em>y</em> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> The given equation, <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>y,</em> is the standard equation of the parabola with vertex at origin (0,0) and 4<em>p</em> =1 ⇒ its focal length is <em>p</em> = 1/4. Since the parabola opens upward, its focus is <em>p</em> units above its vertex ⇒ its focus is at F(0,1/4); and its directrix is horizontal line <em>p</em> units below its vertex ⇒ its directrix is <em>y</em> = −1/4. You may sketch this parabola.</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.15</alert>: If a parabola opens upward and the endpoints of its latus rectum are at <em>A</em>(−4, 1) and <em>B</em>(2, 1), then find the equation of the parabola, its directrix and sketch it.</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> Since the focus <em>F</em> of the parabola is at the midpoint of its latus rectum <em>AB</em>, we have</p>
<p><image source="/media/png72/imageC2285.png" />, and focal width <image source="/media/png72/imageC2286.png" /> ⇒ focal length <em>p</em> = 3/2. Moreover, as the parabola opens upward its vertex is <em>p</em> units below its focus. That is,</p>
<p>V (<em>h</em>, <em>k</em>) = ( −1, 1−3/2) = ( −1, −1/2). Therefore, the equation of the parabola is</p>
<p><image source="/media/png72/imageC2287.png" />.</p>
<p>And its directrix is horizontal line <em>p</em> units below its vertex, which is <em>y</em> = −1/2 −3/2 = −2.</p>
<p>The parabola is sketch in the Figure 4.14 .</p>

<p><alert>II: Equation of a parabola whose axis is parallel to the <em>x</em>-axis</alert>.</p>
<p>A parabola whose axis is parallel to <em><alert>x</alert></em>-axis is called <alert>horizontal parabola</alert>. Such parabola opens either to the right or to the left as shown in Figure 4.15 (a) and (b), respectively.</p>
<p>The equations of such sec-parabolas can be obtained by interchanging the role of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in the equations of the sec-parabolas discussed previously. These equations are stated below. In both cases, let the vertex of the parabola be at V(<em>h,k</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a horizontal parabola <alert>opens to</alert> t<alert>he right (</alert>as in Fig.4.15(a) ), then its focus is to the right of V at F(<em>h+p, k</em>), its directrix is <em>x =h−p</em>, and its equation is</p></li>

<li><p>If a parabola <alert>opens to</alert> t<alert>he left (</alert>as in Figure 4.15 (b) ), then its focus is to the left of V at F(<em>h−p,k</em>), its directrix is <em>x=h+p</em> , and its equation is:</p></li>

<p>If the vertices of these sec-parabolas are at the origin (0,0), then you can obtain their corresponding equations by setting <em>h</em>=0 and <em>k</em>=0 in the above equations.</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.16</alert>: Find the focus and directrix of the parabola <image source="/media/png72/imageC2291.png" /> and sketch its graph.</p>
<p><alert>Solution</alert>: The equation is <image source="/media/png72/imageC2292.png" />; and comparing this with the above equation, it is an equation of a parabola whose vertex is at (0,0), axis of symmetry is the x-axis, open to the left and 4<em>p</em>=10, i.e., <em>p</em>=5/2. Thus, the focus is F=(–5/2,0) and its directrix is <em>x</em> =5/2. Its graph is sketched in Figure 4.16.</p>
<p><image source="/media/png72/imageC2291.png" /></p>
<p><alert>Example 4.17</alert>: Find the focus and directrix of the parabola <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> + 4<em>y</em> + 8<em>x</em> – 4 = 0 and sketch it.</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> The eaquation is <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> +4<em>y</em> = –8<em>x</em> +4. ( Now complete the square of <em>y</em>-terms)</p>

<p>⇒ <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> + 4<em>y+</em><alert>2<sup>2</sup></alert> = –8<em>x</em> +4+<alert>4</alert></p>
<p>⇒ (<em>y</em> +2)<sup>2</sup> = –8<em>x</em> +8</p>
<p>⇒ (<em>y</em> + 2)<sup>2</sup> = –8(<em>x</em> –1)</p>

<p>This is equation of a parabola with vertex at (<em>h, k</em>)=(1,–2), open to the left and focal length <em>p</em>, where 4<em>p=</em>8 ⇒ <em>p=</em>2. Therefore, its focus is</p>
<p>F= (<em>h</em>–<em>p, k</em>) = (–1, –2), and directrix <em>x</em>=<em>h</em>+<em>p</em> =3. The parabola is sketched in Figure 4.17.</p>

<p>may represent a parabola whose axis is parallel to the <em><alert>y</alert></em>-axis or parallel to the <em><alert>x</alert></em>-axis, respectively. The vertex, focal length and focus for such sec-parabolas can be identified after converting the equations into one of the standard forms by completing the square.</p></cell>
