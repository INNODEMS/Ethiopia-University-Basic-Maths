            <alert>I: Equation of a parabola whose axis is parallel to the <em>y</em>-axis</alert>:
        </p>
        <p>
            A parabola whose axis is parallel to <em><alert>y</alert></em>-axis is called <alert>vertical parabola</alert>. A vertical parabola is either open upward (as in Figure 4.13 (a) ) or open downward (as in Figure 4.13 (b)).

            Let <em>p</em> be the distance from vertex V(<em>h,k</em>) to the focus F of the parabola, i.e.,<alert>|</alert>VF<alert>|</alert> = <em>p</em>. Then, by the definition, F is located <em>p</em> units above V if the parabola opens upward and it is located <em>p</em> units below V if the parabola opens downward as indicated on Figure 4.13(a) and (b), respectively. To determine the desired equation, we first consider the case when the parabola opens upward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, considering a vertical parabola with vertex V(<em>h,k</em>) that opens upward (Figure 4.13a), its focus is at F(<em>h, k+p</em>). ⇒ The equation of its directrix is <em>y = k−p.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, for any point P(<em>x,y</em>) on the parabola, <alert>|</alert>PF<alert>|</alert> is equal to the distance between P and the directrix if and only if

        <p>
            A parabola whose axis is parallel to <em><alert>x</alert></em>-axis is called <alert>horizontal parabola</alert>. Such parabola opens either to the right or to the left as shown in Figure 4.15 (a) and (b), respectively.

            The equations of such sec-parabolas can be obtained by interchanging the role of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in the equations of the sec-parabolas discussed previously. These equations are stated below. In both cases, let the vertex of the parabola be at V(<em>h,k</em>).
