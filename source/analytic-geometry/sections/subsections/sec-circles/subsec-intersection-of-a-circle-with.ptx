    <title>Intersection of a circle with a line and tangent line to a circle</title>

    <p>
        The number of intersection points of a given line and a circle is at most two;
        that is, either no intersection point, or only one intersection point, 
        or two intersection points. For instance, 
        in Figure 4.9, the line <m>l_1</m> has no intersection with the circle, 
        <m>l_2 </m> has two intersection points with the circle, namely, <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_2</m>, 
        and <m>l_3</m> has only one intersection point with the circle, namely, P.
    </p>
    <p>
        A line which intersects a circle at one and only one point is called a <alert>tangent line</alert> to the circle. 
        In this case, the intersection point is called the <alert>point of tangency</alert>. 
        Thus, <m>l_3 </m> a tangent line to the circle in Figure 4.9 and P is the point of tangency.

    <p>
        In Figure 4.9, observe that every point on <m> l_1</m> are outside of the circle. 
        Hence, <em>d</em>(C,Q) &gt; <em>r</em> for every point Q on <m>l_1</m>. 
        Consequently, <m>d(C, l_1) &gt; r</m>. 
        On the other hand, there is a point on <m>l_2</m> which is inside the circle. 
        Hence, <m>d(C, l_2) &lt; r</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        For the tangent line <m>l_3 </m> the point of tangency P is on the circle implies that <m>|CP| = r</m> and P is the point on <m>l_3 </m>closest to C. 
        Therefore, <m>d(C, l) = |CP|= r</m>. 
        This shows also that CP⊥ <m>l_3</m>.

    </p>
    <p>
        In general, given a circle of radius <em>r</em> with center C(<em>h</em>,<em>k</em>) and a line <em><alert>l</alert></em> , 
        by computing the distance <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) between C and <em><alert>l</alert></em> we can conclude the following.

                <p>
                    If <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) &gt; <em>r</em>, 
                    then the line does not intersect with the circle.

                    If <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) &lt; <em>r</em>,
                    then the line is a secant of the circle; 
                    that is, they have two intersection points.

                    If <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) = <em>r</em>, then <em><alert>l</alert></em> is a tangent line to the circle. 
                    The point of tangency is the point P on the line (and on the circle) such that CP <alert>⊥ <em>l</em></alert> <alert>.</alert> 
                    This means the product of the slopes of <em><alert>l</alert></em> and CP must be <m>-1</m>.

                Let C(<em>h, k</em>) be the center of the circle.
                (<em>h, k</em>) is on the line <m>y =(1/2)x ⇒ k =(1/2)h</m> ; and
                the circle is tangent to x-axis at P<m>(6,0) ⇒ </m>CP should be perpendicular to the x-axis.
            </p>
            <p>
            <m> ⇒ h = 6 ⇒ k= 3</m> and the radius is <em>r</em> <m>= |CP| = k-0 =3</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, the circle is centered at <m>(6, 3)</m> with radius <em>r</em> <m>=3</m>.
                Therefore, the equation of the circle is <m>(x - 6)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 9</m> .

                If the center of the circle is on the <em><alert>x</alert></em>-axis,

            <p>
                Let the center of the circle be C(<em>h</em>,0). 
                We need to find <em>h</em>. The slope of the line <em><alert>l</alert></em> : <em>y=x</em> is <m>1</m> and <em><alert>l</alert></em> is perpendicular to CP. 
                Hence the slope of CP is <m>-1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the slope of CP <m>= \frac{2-0}{2-h} = -1 ⇒ h-2=2</m> or <m>h=4</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>⇒ </m>The center of the circle is C<m>(4,0)</m>; and <m> r^2 = |CP|^2 = (2-0)^2 + (2 - 4)^2 = 4+4= 8.</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the equation of the circle is <m>(x - 4)^2 + y^2= r^2 = 8</m>.
