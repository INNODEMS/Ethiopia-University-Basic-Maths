<title>Intersection of a circle with a line and tangent line to a circle</title>

<p>The number of intersection points of a given line and a circle is at most two; that is, either no intersection point, or only one intersection point, or two intersection points. For instance, in Figure 4.9, the line <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub> has no intersection with the circle, <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub> has two intersection points with the circle, namely, Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>, and <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>3</sub> has only one intersection point with the circle, namely, P.</p>
<p>A line which intersects a circle at one and only one point is called a <alert>tangent line</alert> to the circle. In this case, the intersection point is called the <alert>point of tangency</alert>. Thus, <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>3</sub> a tangent line to the circle in Figure 4.9 and P is the point of tangency.</p>
<p>In Figure 4.9, observe that every point on <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub> are outside of the circle. Hence, <em>d</em>(C,Q) &gt; <em>r</em> for every point Q on <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub>. Consequently, <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>1</sub>) &gt; <em>r</em>. On the other hand, there is a point on <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub> which is inside the circle. Hence, <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>2</sub>) &lt; <em>r</em>.</p>
<p>For the tangent line <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>3,</sub> the point of tangency P is on the circle implies that <em><alert>|</alert></em>CP<alert>|</alert> = <em>r</em> and P is the point on <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>3</sub> closest to C. Therefore, <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>3</sub>) = <em><alert>|</alert></em>CP<alert>|</alert> = <em>r</em>. This shows also that CP⊥ <em><alert>l</alert></em><sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>In general, given a circle of radius <em>r</em> with center C(<em>h</em>,<em>k</em>) and a line <em><alert>l</alert></em> , by computing the distance <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) between C and <em><alert>l</alert></em> we can conclude the following.</p>

<p>(i). If <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) &gt; <em>r</em>, then the line does not intersect with the circle.</p>
<p>(ii) If <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) &lt; <em>r</em>, then the line is a secant of the circle; that is, they have two intersection points.</p>
<p>(iii) If <em>d</em>(C, <em><alert>l</alert></em>) = <em>r</em>, then <em><alert>l</alert></em> is a tangent line to the circle. The point of tangency is the point P on the line (and on the circle) such that CP <alert>⊥ <em>l</em></alert> <alert>.</alert> This means the product of the slopes of <em><alert>l</alert></em> and CP must be −1.</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.12</alert> Write the equation of the circle tangent to the <em><alert>x</alert></em>-axis at (6,0) whose center is on the line <em>x</em> −2y = 0.</p>

<p><alert>Solution:</alert> The circle in the question is as in Figure 4.10.</p>

<p>Let C(<em>h, k</em>) be the center of the circle. (<em>h, k</em>) is on the line <em>y</em> =(1/2)<em>x</em> ⇒ <em>k</em> =(1/2)<em>h</em> ; and</p>
<p>the circle is tangent to x-axis at P(6,0) ⇒ CP should be perpendicular to the x-axis.</p>
<p>⇒ <em>h</em> = 6 ⇒ <em>k</em>= 3 and the radius is <em>r</em> = |CP| = <em>k</em>−0 =3.</p>

<p>Hence, the circle is centered at (6, 3) with radius <em>r</em> =3. Therefore, the equation of the circle is (<em>x –</em> 6)<sup>2</sup> + (<em>y</em>−3)<sup>2</sup> <em>=</em> 9 .</p>
<p><alert>Example 4.13</alert> Suppose the line <em>y=x</em> is tangent to a circle at point P(2,2). If the center of the circle is on the <em><alert>x</alert></em>-axis, then what is the equation of the circle?</p>
<p><alert>Solution:</alert> The circle in the question is as in Figure 4.11.</p>

<p>Let the center of the circle be C(<em>h</em>,0). We need to find <em>h</em>. The slope of the line <em><alert>l</alert></em> : <em>y=x</em> is 1 and <em><alert>l</alert></em> is perpendicular to CP. Hence the slope of CP is –1.</p>
<p>So, the slope of CP = <image source="/media/png72/imageC2273.png" /> <image source="/media/png72/imageC2274.png" /></p>
<p>⇒ The center of the circle is C(4,0); and <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = |CP|<sup>2</sup> = (2– 0)<sup>2</sup> + (2– 4)<sup>2</sup> = 4+4= 8.</p>
<p>Therefore, the equation of the circle is (<em>x</em> – 4)<sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>= <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 8.</p>
