<p>In the previous sections we have seen that, except in degenerate cases, the graph of the equation</p>
<p>A<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + C<em>y</em><sup>2</sup> + D<em>x</em> + E<em>y</em> + F = 0</p>
<p>is a circle, parabola, ellipse or hyperbola. The construction of these equations was based on the assumption that the axis of symmetry of a conic section is parallel to one of the coordinate axes. The assumption seems to be quite restrictive because the axis of symmetry for a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola can be any oblique line as indicated in their corresponding definitions (See Figures 4.12, 4.18 and 4.24).</p>
<p>However, the reason why we have assumed that is not only for simplicity but there is always a coordinate system whose one of the axes is parallel to a desired line of symmetry. In particular, we can rotate the axes of our <em>xy</em><alert>-</alert>coordinate system, whenever needed, so as to form a new <em>x</em>'<em>y</em>'-coordinate system such that either the x'- axis or y'-axis is parallel to the desired line of symmetry. Toward this end, let us review the notion of rotation of axes.</p>
