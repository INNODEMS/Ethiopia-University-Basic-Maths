    <title>The Real and Complex Number Systems</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In everyday life, knowingly or unknowingly, we are doing with numbers.
            Therefore, it will be nice if we get familiarized with numbers. 
            Whatever course (which needs the concept of mathematics) we take, 
            we face with the concept of numbers directly or indirectly. 
            For this purpose, numbers and their basic properties will be introduced under this chapter.
