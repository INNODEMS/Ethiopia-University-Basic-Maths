        <p>
            The history of numbers indicated that the first set of numbers used by the ancient human beings 
            for counting purpose was the set of natural (counting) numbers.

                    The set of natural numbers is denoted by <m>\mathbf{N}</m> and is described 
                    as <m>\mathbf{N} = \left\{ \ 1\ ,\ 2,\ 3,\ \ldots\  \right\}</m>

        <title>Operations on the set of natural numbers</title>
            <p>
                <m>\textbf{i) Addition } (+)</m>
            </p>
            <p> If two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are added using the operation
                “+”, then the sum <em>a</em>+<em>b</em> is also a natural number. 
                If the sum of the two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> is denoted 
                by <em>c</em>, then we can write the operation as: <em>c</em> = <em>a</em>+<em>b</em>, 
                where <em>c</em> is called the sum and <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are called terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: 3+8 = 11, here 11 is the sum whereas 3 &amp; 8 are terms.

                <m>\textbf{ii) Multiplication }(\times)</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                If two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are multiplied using the operation “<m></m>”, 
                then the product <em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em> is also a natural number. 
                If the product of the two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> is denoted by <em>c</em>, 
                then we can write the operation as: <em>c</em> = <em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em>, where <em>c</em> is called 
                the product and <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are called factors.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        <m> 3+4 = 12</m>, here <m>12</m> is the product whereas <m>3</m> &amp; <m>4</m> are factors.

            <p>
                i. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, the sum <em>a</em>+<em>b</em> is also a natural number. 
                For instance in the above example, <m>3</m> and <m>8</m> are natural numbers, their sum <m>11</m> is also a natural number.
                In general, we say that the set of natural numbers is closed under addition.
            </p>
            <p>
                ii. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = <em>b</em> + <em>a</em>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        <m>3+8 = 8+3 = 11</m>. In general, we say that addition is commutative on the set of natural numbers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                iii. For any three natural numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &amp; <em>c</em>, (<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)+<em>c</em> = <em>a</em> +(<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>).
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        (3+8)+6 = 3+(8+6) = 17. In general, we say that addition is associative on the set of natural numbers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                iv. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, the product <em>a</em><m>\times</m><em>b</em> is also a natural number. 
                For instance in the above example, <m>3</m> and <m>4</m> are natural numbers, their product <m>12</m> is also a natural number. 
                In general, we say that the set of natural numbers is closed under multiplication.
            </p>
            <p>
                v. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, <em>a</em><m>\times</m><em>b</em> = <em>b</em><m>\times</m><em>a</em>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        3<m>\times</m>4 = 4<m>\times</m>3 = 12. In general, we say that multiplication is commutative on the set of natural numbers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                vi. For any three natural numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &amp; <em>c</em>, (<em>a</em><m>\times</m><em>b</em>) <m>\times</m><em>c</em> = <em>a</em><m>\times</m> (<em>b</em><m>\times</m><em>c</em>).
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        (2<m>\times</m>4) <m>\times</m>5 = 2<m>\times</m> (4<m>\times</m>5) = 40. In general, we say that multiplication is associative on the set of natural numbers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                vii. For any natural number <em>a</em>, it holds that <em>a</em><m>\times</m>1 = 1<m>\times</m><em>a</em> = <em>a</em>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        6<m>\times</m>1 = 1<m>\times</m>6 = 6. In general, we say that multiplication has an identity element on the set of natural numbers and <m>1</m> is the identity element.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                For any three natural numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &amp; <em>c</em>, <em>a</em><m>\times</m><alert>(</alert><em>b</em>+<em>c</em>) = (<em>a</em><m>\times</m><em>b</em>)+(<em>a</em><m>\times</m><em>c</em>).
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        3<m>\times</m>(5+7) = (3<m>\times</m>5)+ (3<m>\times</m>7) <m>=</m> 36. 
                        In general, we say that multiplication is distributive over addition on the set of natural numbers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <note>
                <p>
                    Consider two numbers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, we say <em>a</em> is greater than <em>b</em> denoted by <em>a</em> &gt; <em>b</em> if <em>a</em> – <em>b</em> is positive.

                        Every composite number can be expressed as a product of its prime factors.
                        This factorization is unique except the order of the factors.

            Mathematical induction is one of the most important techniques used to prove in mathematics.
