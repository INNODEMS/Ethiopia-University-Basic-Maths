<p>The history of numbers indicated that the first set of numbers used by the ancient human beings for counting purpose was the set of natural (counting) numbers.</p>

<h4 id="operations-on-the-set-of-natural-numbers">Operations on the set of natural numbers</h4>
<p><alert>i) Addition (+)</alert></p>
<p>If two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are added using the operation “+”, then the sum <em>a</em>+<em>b</em> is also a natural number. If the sum of the two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> is denoted by <em>c</em>, then we can write the operation as: <em>c</em> = <em>a</em>+<em>b</em>, where <em>c</em> is called the sum and <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are called terms.</p>
<p>Example: 3+8 = 11, here 11 is the sum whereas 3 &amp; 8 are terms.</p>
<p><alert>ii) Multiplication (</alert><m></m><alert>)</alert></p>
<p>If two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are multiplied using the operation “<m></m>”, then the product <em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em> is also a natural number. If the product of the two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> is denoted by <em>c</em>, then we can write the operation as: <em>c</em> = <em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em>, where <em>c</em> is called the product and <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em> are called factors.</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.3</alert>: 3<m></m>4 = 12, here 12 is the product whereas 3 &amp; 4 are factors.</p>
<p><alert>Properties of addition and multiplication on the set of natural numbers</alert></p>
<p>i. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, the sum <em>a</em>+<em>b</em> is also a natural number. For instance in the</p>
<p>above example, 3 and 8 are natural numbers, their sum 11 is also a natural number. In general, we</p>
<p>say that the set of natural numbers is closed under addition.</p>
<p>ii. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = <em>b</em> + <em>a</em>.</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.1</alert>: 3+8 = 8+3 = 11. In general, we say that addition is commutative on the set of natural numbers.</p>
<p>iii. For any three natural numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &amp; <em>c</em>, (<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)+<em>c</em> = <em>a</em> +(<em>b</em>+<em>c</em>).</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.2</alert>: (3+8)+6 = 3+(8+6) = 17. In general, we say that addition is associative on the set of natural numbers.</p>
<p>iv. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, the product <em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em> is also a natural number. For instance in the above example, 3 and 4 are natural numbers, their product 12 is also a natural number. In general, we say that the set of natural numbers is closed under multiplication.</p>
<p>v. For any two natural numbers <em>a</em> &amp; <em>b</em>, <em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em> = <em>b</em><m></m><em>a</em>.</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.4</alert>: 3<m></m>4 = 4<m></m>3 = 12. In general, we say that multiplication is commutative on the set of natural numbers.</p>
<p>vi. For any three natural numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &amp; <em>c</em>, (<em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em>) <m></m><em>c</em> = <em>a</em><m></m> (<em>b</em><m></m><em>c</em>).</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.5</alert>: (2<m></m>4) <m></m>5 = 2<m></m> (4<m></m>5) = 40. In general, we say that multiplication is associative on the set of natural numbers.</p>
<p>vi. For any natural number <em>a</em>, it holds that <em>a</em><m></m>1 = 1<m></m><em>a</em> = <em>a</em>.</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.6</alert>: 6<m></m>1 = 1<m></m>6 = 6. In general, we say that multiplication has an identity element on the set of natural numbers and 1 is the identity element.</p>
<p>vii. For any three natural numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> &amp; <em>c</em>, <em>a</em><m></m><alert>(</alert><em>b</em><alert>+</alert><em>c</em>) = (<em>a</em><m></m><em>b</em>)+(<em>a</em><m></m><em>c</em>).</p>
<p><alert>Example 2.1.7</alert>: 3<m></m>(5+7) = (3<m></m>5)+ (3<m></m>7) = 36. In general, we say that multiplication is distributive over addition on the set of natural numbers.</p>
