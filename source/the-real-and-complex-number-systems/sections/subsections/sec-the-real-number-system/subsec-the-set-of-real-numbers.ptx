<cell><p>A number is called a real number if and only if it is either a rational number or an irrational number.</p>
<p>The set of real numbers denoted by <m>\Re</m> can be described as the union of the set of rational and irrational numbers. i.e <m>\Re</m>= {x : x is a rational number or an irrational number}.</p></cell>

<p>There is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of real numbers and the number line (For each point in the number line, there is a corresponding real number and vice-versa).</p>
<h4 id="operations-on-the-set-of-real-numbers">Operations on the set of real numbers</h4>
<p><alert>i) Addition (+)</alert></p>
<p>If two real numbers are added using the operation “+”, then the sum is also a real number.</p>
<p><alert>ii) Subtraction (</alert><m>-</m><alert>)</alert></p>
<p>For any two real numbers <m>a</m>&amp; <m>b</m>, the operation of subtracting <m>b</m> from <m>a</m>, denoted by <m>a - b</m>is defined by <m>a - b</m> = <m>a</m>+(<m>-</m><m>b</m>).</p>
<p><alert>iii) Multiplication (</alert><m></m><alert>)</alert></p>
<p>If two real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are multiplied using the operation “<m></m>”, then the product defined as <m>a \times b = \text{ab}</m> is also a real number.</p>
<p><alert>iv) Division (</alert><m></m><alert>)</alert></p>
<p>For any two real numbers <m>a</m>&amp; <m>b</m>, dividing <m>a</m>by <m>b</m>is defined by <m>a\  \div b = a \times \frac{1}{b},\ b \neq 0\text{.}</m></p>
<p><alert>Properties of addition and multiplication on the set of real numbers</alert></p>
<p>Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> be three real numbers, then</p>
<p>i. The set of real numbers is closed under addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>ii. Addition and multiplication are commutative on the set of real numbers.</p>
<p>iii. Addition and multiplication are associative on the set of real numbers.</p>
<p>iv. <alert>0</alert> is the additive identity</p>
<p>i.e., <m>a</m>+ <alert>0</alert> = <alert>0</alert>+<m>a</m> = <m>a</m>.</p>
<p>v. Every real number has an additive inverse.</p>
<p>i.e., <m>a</m>+ <m>( - a)</m> = <m>- a</m>+<m>a</m> = <alert>0</alert>.</p>
<p>vi. <alert>1</alert> is the multiplicative identity</p>
<p>i.e., <m>a</m><m></m>1 = <alert>1</alert><m></m><m>a</m> = <m>a</m>.</p>
<p>vii. Every non-zero real number has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
<p>i.e., <m>a</m><m></m> <m>\frac{1}{a}</m> = <m>\frac{1}{a}</m><m></m><m>a</m> = 1.</p>
<h4 id="the-real-number-and-the-number-line">The real number and the number line</h4>
<p>One of the most important properties of the real number is that it can be represented graphically by points on a straight line. The point 0 is termed as the origin. Points to the right of 0 are called positive real numbers and points to the left of 0 are called negative real numbers. Each point on the number line corresponds a unique real number and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Geometrically we say a is greater than b if a is located to the right of b on the number line.</p>
